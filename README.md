## Overview

**SolarTokenV3Optimized** is an ERC-1155 smart contract designed for tokenizing solar energy projects. It enables the creation of investment projects, token minting, revenue distribution, and transparent tracking of energy production.

## Features

### 🔋 Project Management
- **Create Projects**: Anyone can create solar energy investment projects with customizable parameters
- **Project Metadata**: Each project includes name, total supply, price per token, and minimum purchase requirements
- **Project Status Control**: Creators can activate/deactivate their projects
- **Ownership Transfer**: Project ownership can be transferred to another address

### 💰 Token Economics
- **ERC-1155 Multi-Token**: Each project has its own token ID
- **Flexible Pricing**: Configurable price per token in Wei
- **Minimum Purchase**: Enforced minimum token purchase per transaction
- **Automatic Refunds**: Excess payments are automatically refunded

### 📊 Revenue Distribution
- **Deposit Revenue**: Project creators can deposit revenue from energy production
- **Fair Distribution**: Revenue is distributed proportionally based on token holdings
- **Claim Rewards**: Investors can claim accumulated rewards at any time
- **Batch Claims**: Claim rewards from multiple projects in a single transaction

### ⚡ Energy Tracking
- **Energy Updates**: Track total energy produced in kWh
- **Transparent Metrics**: On-chain visibility of energy generation data

### 🔒 Security Features
- **Ownable**: Admin functions restricted to contract owner
- **Pausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Custom Errors**: Gas-efficient error handling
